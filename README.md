# HB Code Assignment

Run Project : Project has sqlite database. When you press run button, you can easily start project.

Project Structure: 

The project was prepared according to the ddd architecture. Using autofac for service provider to create a modular structure.
Also using Decorator and Strategy patterns to reduce dependencies as much as possible. While preparing the project, I was tried to adhere to the SOLID rules.

I also used web api as client project and integrated swagger. If you upload the file to run the example, you can see the result in the swagger console.
